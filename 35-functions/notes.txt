1 - Function that returns nothing
- We can have functions that don't returns values
- Wich type of data is indicated to use in this situation?
- In this case, we ill use void!
- It will tell to TS that we don't have a return value
- Let's pratice!


2 - Callback 
- We can insert a callback function as function argument
- Inside it we can define the type of argument allow for callback
- And also the return type
- Callback is an asynchronous function, that is does not follow the natural flow of code
- Let's pratice!

3 - Generic Functions
- Is a strategy to qhen the the type of return is related to type of argument
- For example: An item of an array can be string, boolean or number
- Normaly are used leters like T or U to define the generics
- Let's pratice!

4 - Constraints in the Generic Functions
- The generic functions can have a reduce escope using contraints
- Basicly we limit the types that can be used in Generic
- That makes our code be less comprehensive
- Let's pratice! 

5 - Especify type of argument
- In Generic Functions we have to use parameters with similar types
- But there is a possibility to also define the type of paremeters allow, with an especial sintax
- This makes the validation of TS allow the type that was choosed
- Let's pratice!
