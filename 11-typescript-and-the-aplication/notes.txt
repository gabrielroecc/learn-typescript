TS and the aplication
- Maybe you already got, but programming with TS is like a pair programming
- We have the code to tell us if something is wrong
- After compilation, TS don't have effect, they can't help us after compile
- So there is a compilation crash with errors
- In additions to mistakes, TS also ensures alerts
